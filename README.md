# PCA-lecture
A lecture on using PCA in Computational Biology

In order to build the document you need to first run both `SetUpGO.R` and `OSCAmultisample.R`.

The latter takes quite a while to run, and you might instead just edit out those slides from the lecture.

There is a file, `package_versions.csv` that contains a list of all the packages you need. 
They are obtained by running `sessionInfo()` after having sourced both of the other scripts.
